    <p class="ad sd"> A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica which is believed to have
        originated from the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been
        cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two distinct types of modern mango
        cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type". Other species in the genus Mangifera also
        produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian
        ecoregion.</p>
